## 🇦🇹 Austria

The alphanumeric format for registration plates is "XX ∇ number+letter(s)" or "XX ∇ personalised letters+number";

XX - one or two letters which indicate the local registration office (district where the registered possessor resides). As a general rule, State capitals have one letter; other districts have two letters.
∇ - the coat of arms of the Austrian state the district belongs to have a dash (–) instead
A three to six-letter/number sequence which uniquely distinguishes each of the vehicles displaying the same initial area code. 

- **The letter `Q` is excluded from all sequences**.
